## 🔧 Configuration

### Langflow Flow Components

The Langflow flow consists of:
- **Chat Input** - Entry point for queries
- **Excel to Database** - Converts Excel to SQLite database
- **Text to SQL** - Converts natural language to SQL
- **SQL Database** - Executes SQL queries
- **Chat Output** - Returns formatted results



## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Cannot connect to Langflow"**
- Ensure Langflow is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Check if the Flow ID is correct
- Verify firewall settings

**2. "Could not understand audio"**
- Speak clearly and closer to the microphone
- Reduce background noise
- Check microphone permissions
- Try increasing recording duration

**3. "No data returned"**
- Verify Excel file is uploaded in Langflow
- Check database connection in Langflow
- Test the query directly in Langflow first

**4. "Query execution failed"**
- Verify your query syntax
- Check if the table/column names exist
- Review the error message in the expander

## 🔐 Security Notes

- All processing happens locally
- No data is sent to external servers (except Google Speech API for transcription)
- Excel files are stored in your local Langflow instance
- Database queries are executed in a sandboxed environment

## ⚠️ Important Note

**This project is for educational and demonstration purposes.** While it showcases the power of AI-driven natural language processing for database queries, please ensure you:

- **Review all generated SQL queries** before execution in production environments
- **Implement proper security measures** (authentication, authorization, input validation)
- **Test thoroughly** with your specific use case and data
- **Handle sensitive data** according to your organization's security policies
- **Add rate limiting** and error handling for production use

The voice recognition feature uses Google's Speech Recognition API, which requires an internet connection and is subject to Google's usage policies and quotas.

**Use at your own risk** - The developers are not responsible for any data loss, security breaches, or issues arising from the use of this software.
